# Final-Project-Data-Science-101
Final project for data science 101.
This repository has two key components:

Main Code: This code uses several machine learning algorithms— KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and an Ensemble Model—to classify data from an early-stage Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) dataset.

Adjusted Code for Better Recall: This builds on the main code but changes some parameters to improve recall, because in IHD, false negatives are much more problematic than false positives, so the goal here is to maximize recall without sacrificing too much precision.
